[Union City], the central city of the western continents, was attacked and demolished by both Phillon planet''s and Shrines coalition army due to Shrines nationalist policy.

You have quite an impressive degree of operational skill but how will you fare in an real fight? I would like to test you once again. Fly to [Stone Ruins] right now and bring 3 [Killmark of Bombing Exerciser] and 1 [Killmark of Fighter Exerciser] back to me. These GEARs, which operate mainly on A.I, are made primarily for testing fresh pilots. If you bring them to me I will recognize you as a member of our our Mercenary Army. Of course, you will also receive compensation for a job well done. As this is only your first job your reward will only be [320SPI]. Good luck, we''re counting on you!';

It''s an unusual force, as military discipline and freedom both lie within; it is both a Mercenary Army and a Regular Force. It was originally formed to suppress the rebel forces but due to a sudden rebellion the war came to a state of stagnation. The optimistic Bygeniou City Government recognizes this precious force, [FreeSKA Mercenary Army], as a waste of taxpayer''s money.

In fact, I am worried that you might be a little too anxious for work. So, I would like you to accept a small request from the government. Do you know of a GEAR called [Watcher]? It is a monster from the Shrines planet, who have joined with the Phillon to scout out our territory. Although it has never been much of a threat to us, being that there is nothing important about the [Stone Ruins], our government feels that we should not show how poorly the Decaians are faring right now. Your mission is to bring back their computer box by destroying those GEARs. You will also need to acquire the computer boxes of [Overwatchers] as well. As their name suggests, Overwatchers are more powerful than ordinary Watchers. You will receive [450SPI] as compensation. I wish you a pleasant journey!';

I am frankly annoyed by these kinds of chores. Anyway, with your successful work, I have another chance to discuss this matter with command. Thank you. Your have received your compensation. Until next time.';
$QUEST_103_DESCRIPTION				= 'Actually, the Watchers are of an old series of GEARs, one which has already lost the ability to record and relay data. They now roam around with no particular purpose, but the Bygeniou government has neglected this fact for the sake of propaganda: To warn the citizens of a possible Shrines/Phillon attack. But a few citizens came to know of this. Voicing their opinion, public accusations were formed claiming that the Bygeniou City Government is distorting the facts with distracting policies. Nowadays, Bygenious public sentiment is slowly being stirred up and, with that, government support is declining day by day.';

It is typically not a belligerent creature but they can lash out if you get too close. According to intelligence sources, a few days ago one of the queen bees (aka [Hornian Queen]) came outside of her lair to lay eggs in Petra''s cave. The government has taken quite an interest to this information. If you can bring me 1~2 of these eggs, they are willing to develop an exclusive weapon for Hornian hunting. While this is not our typical line of work the government has specifically requested us to bring these back. I have decided to send you on this mission so you could learn more about the cave. Go to [Petra''s Cave] and bring back 2 samples of [Egg DNA of Hornian Queen]. It''s easy to acquire: Just shoot the Hornian''s egg. When you have attained the samples go straight to the end of the cave and our retrieval system will bring you back. It should be a piece of cake for someone such as yourself. Payment for this mission will be [640SPI] and 1 [Bonus Stat]. Good luck!';

$QUEST_104_SUCCESS_TALK				= 'Message from <Krueitoen Andersson>, leader of the Mercenary Army: Have you accomplished your mission? The way you flew, it couldn''t have been your first time through the cave! It must have been a tough flight flying through such a narrow place. You surpassed my expectations. Anyway, your pay should have already been sent. Have you set your bonus stat yet? If you wish to have a powerful attack powered GEAR use it on attack or if you wish for high defense power you should use it on defense. Think carefully before deciding which stat to set. Detailed information on stat allocation can be obtained from various sources. I will be meeting with the council again and we will be discussing further tasks for our little army. We need to appear more active to the citizenry. What do you think? I''m concerned that this recent silence between us and the council forecasts hard times for the future. Well.. I hope that my concerns are unfounded...';
$QUEST_104_DESCRIPTION				= 'No one knows for sure why a Hornian Queen, who typically stays within her lair, has laid eggs in [Petra''s Cave], which is not even Hornian territory. I doubt there is any simple reason behind this. This incident was merely a small result of the change in Phillon planet. Decaians were happy that they found a way to effectively eliminate Hornians, but they failed to realize that the massive energy consumption used to eliminate the Hornians will createe difficulties for Deca, Vatallus, and the Shrines in the near future.';

$QUEST_105_PRE_TALK					= 'Message from <Krueitoen Andersson>, leader of the Mercenary Army: This request is to hunt a monster called [Bonebat]. Bygeniou City Institute is in need of a special solvent. Fortunately, the Bonebat''s gastric juice is very acidic, so much so that it can even melt steel. It is very easy to burn so it will be an effective substance for making new GEAR parts. When these new parts come out the institute might even give them to us with a little discount. Not bad, huh? I know what you''re thinking and it may seem like an unimportant job but I have assigned this task to all the other mercenaries with your level of skill. Just go to [Stone Ruins] and bring down [Bonebat]. Occasionally they will drop a [Gastric Juice Pocket of Bonebat]. Gather 7 of these for me. You will be compensated with [680SPI]. I wish you a pleasant journey!';
$QUEST_105_MID_TALK					= 'Mission already in progress. Obtain 7 [Gastric Juice Pocket of Bonebat]. [Gastric Juice Pocket of Bonebat] can be obtained by bringing down [Bonebat] at [Stone Ruins].';
$QUEST_105_SUCCESS_TALK				= 'Message from <Krueitoen Andersson>, leader of the Mercenary Army: Thank you for doing such a chore without complaining. As you know, we haven''t been given many assignments lately. By the way, I have heard from a government informant that Arlington rebels are trying to finalize plans for the reconstruction of their city. They are working to become self-sufficient, right down to the food and water. But they are so poor at this time. It must be so hard for them to find food as it is such a infertile area. As they are preparing their food supplies they are also preparing for war. When this happens, there will be a fierce battles between the two opposing sides. So be ready for this. You know what they say, someone who prepares for everything will be ready for anything.';
$QUEST_105_DESCRIPTION				= 'Unlike Bygeniou government, which is not concerned at all about the war, the Arlington Government is devising its own city plan for a stronghold. [Arlington City] is surrounded by a desert and an ice field, so it has received food support from Vatallus who provided basic foodstuffs and converted them into compound food. Naturally, there has been some dissatisfaction amongst the residents, but with their passion for a racial alliance, the improved relations with Vatallus has increased day by day.';

$QUEST_106_QUEST_NAME				= 'The Shrines'' Lookout';
$QUEST_106_PRE_TALK					= 'Message from <Krueitoen Andersson>, leader of the Mercenary Army: I have just recently received an urgent message from the intelligence department. The Watchers you helped to keep under control have resumed their activities. Rumour has it that they were not being controlled at all. Also a new monster called [Superwatcher] has appeared out of nowhere. Your purpose for this mission is to go to [Stone Ruins] and confirm the existence of the [Superwatcher]. If the rumours are true, shoot down the [Superwatcher] to acquire its [Record Data of Superwatcher]. The intelligence department has informed me that [Superwatcher] can be found near the waterfall, the broken windmill and the broken air defense artillery. If you search these areas carefully you should find them. Well, you cannot trust the officials 100% but it is the only reliable source we have at the moment. You will receive [830SPI] as compensation. It is quite a generous payment for bringing down just one, isn''t it? I wish you a pleasant journey!';
$QUEST_106_MID_TALK					= 'Mission already in progress. Obtain 1 [Record Data of Superwatcher]. [Record Data of Superwatcher] can be obtained by bringing down [Superwatcher] at [Stone Ruins].';
$QUEST_106_SUCCESS_TALK				= 'Message from <Krueitoen Andersson>, leader of the Mercenary Army: Great job! The record data that you have brought back is now being examined. I think they have been secretly recording the movement of our army. Shrines...I have never thought that they would be looking at us with such a clever camouflage. They must be either irritated by our movement or they are trying to gauge our relations with Arlington. The strange part is that this kind of technology is primitive compared to the Shrines. They didn''t need to use this crude methodology to find out about our army. It would be naive to automatically assume that this work was done by Shrines. We must keep an open mind on these matters. Well, the truth will come out sooner or later. When the record data is decrypted, it will be all be made clear. Anyway, you have done well. Go and have some rest.';
$QUEST_106_DESCRIPTION				= 'The Security Data that was gathered after bringing down the Superwatchers was different from the DECA-Shrines war, so it took quite some time to decrypt the password. Because of this, they tried to find the remaining Superwatchers to obtain more intelligence but they were nowhere to be found. After this incident, the Bygeniou government has ordered the regular army to eliminate all Watchers. This new direction the government is taking most of the citizens by surprise, and are becoming uneasy because of the increasingly strained diplomatic relations with Arlington. The last thing anyone wants to do is provoke the Shrines.';

$QUEST_107_QUEST_NAME				= 'Trouble in the Cave';
$QUEST_107_PRE_TALK					= 'Message from <Krueitoen Andersson>, leader of the Mercenary Army: Do you remember when we asked you to gather [Egg DNA of Hornian Queen]? With the DNA samples that you have sent us, they have created a special item for the Hornian Queen. It is a machine that produces certain radio waves which causes reactions to those with the [Egg DNA of Hornian Queen]. I''m not interested in the petty details, but the institute assures us that it produces a radio wave that is harmless to humans. So how about it? A simple mission back to [Petra''s Cave]? All you will need to do is to load a [Electric Wave Generator] and fly to the end of the cave. The radio wave will stimulate the eggs and in about 30 minutes. Only the skin of the eggs will remain and the rest will have dissolved. It is a simple mission. We will prepare your GEAR for this mission. All you need to do is fly to the end of the cave. For this mission, you will be rewarded [1,040SPI]! Considering what you need to do, it''s easy money, yes? I wish you a pleasant journey!';
$QUEST_107_MID_TALK					= 'Mission already in progress. Commence through Petras cave with the [Electric Wave Generator] in your inventory.';
$QUEST_107_SUCCESS_TALK				= 'Message from <Krueitoen Andersson>, leader of the Mercenary Army: I must apologize. I heard that many of the eggs had hatched already. I never imagined that [Petra''s Cave] would have become so dangerous in such a short time. I''m gonna give the intelligence department guys a piece of my mind! Only a week ago, there were only eggs hovering around the air...I never expected [Ammones]. [Ammones] were monsters that used to be active in [Blackburn Site]. They are essentially younger [Ammon]. But why would they be here? The [Blackburn Site] is a long way from [Petra''s Cave]. [Ammones] don''t just appear out of nowhere; someone must have moved [Ammon]''s larva there. Anyway, well done. With your brave action most of the eggs in the cave were eliminated. The radio wave producer that they have retrieved will be redesigned to eliminate Hornians in [Tylent Jungle]. As far as the monsters in the cave are concerned, I will inform the government and have it taken care of. No need to worry about them. They aren''t your problem anymore. Well done!';
$QUEST_107_DESCRIPTION				= 'Citizens who have heard about this matter have voiced the same concerns that Krueitoen Andersson did. Who brought those [Ammones] there? And why? Could it be Shrines trying to stop the free movement in our territory? Or is it a tactic of the Arlington rebels? Bygeniou citizens are very confused by all the recent events and this has led to a rise of pro-Arlington groups within Bygeniou. The people have become somewhat agitated.';

$QUEST_108_QUEST_NAME				= 'Tylent Jungle';
$QUEST_108_PRE_TALK					= 'Message from <Krueitoen Andersson>, leader of the Mercenary Army: [Petra''s Cave] has become safe once again thanks to your work. Perhaps it is time for you to make a sweep of [Tylent Jungle]. According to Phillon natives, [Tylent Jungle] was a tropical rain forest with wide leaves, green vines, and massive trees. With constant rain and a dense forest making access limited, even Phillon natives could never really explore the region fully. There you will find a group of monsters known as <Hornians>. Based on previous intelligence, Hornians have an organization and hierarchy system with [Hornian Queen] as their leader and royal Hornians directly below her, [Hornian Blazers] below them, and so on. But I''m sure that you already have a high understanding of them due to your previous encounters. There are also other kinds of bugs living within [Tylent Jungle]. Those bugs are not so belligerent so they will not be much of a threat. As they do make it difficult to travel, however, the government leads regular hunting parties against these bugs. We are routinely assigned to take down these pests. Go to [Tylent Jungle] and bring back 7 [Egg of Nating], 5 [Hornian DNA], and 2 [Antenna of Titanmoth]. You will be compensated with [1,290SPI]. I wish you a pleasant journey!';
$QUEST_108_MID_TALK					= 'Mission already in progress. Obtain 7 [Egg of Nating], 5 [Hornian DNA], and 2 [Antenna of Titanmoth]. [Egg of Nating] can be obtained by bringing down [Nating] at [Tylent Jungle]. Similarly, [Hornian DNA] and [Antenna of Titanmoth] can be obtained from [Hornian] in [Tylent Jungle] and [Titanmoth] in [Tylent Jungle], respectively.';
$QUEST_108_SUCCESS_TALK				= 'Message from <Krueitoen Andersson> leader of the Mercenary Army: Welcome back! Did you have any problem with controlling your GEAR due to the heavy rain in the jungle? On my first run, I had such a hard time because of the intense torrential rain. Was the hunt fun? I''ve heard from the hunt commander that the number of Hornians has increased. An increase in Hornians...I guess it''s bad news for our [Bygeniou City]. I personally think that the Hornians are becoming more aggressive toward us because of our hunts. Seriously! Others might not agree with me, but I believe that Hornians possess intelligence. They are not just a normal group of bees. They are systemized thoroughly and their division of labour system is well set. Also, I think that the [Hornian Queen] at their uppermost caste knows something that we do not.

A broadcast coming from these devices, which were dispatched by Arlington, has caused the Bygeniou government to issue a high alert. The government has sent us, the Mercenary Army, to collect these [\wTransmitting Device\w]. The reason they have sent us on this mission rather than their own regular army is due to the broadcast. It has already been 30 minutes since our members have gone out, but seeing that our first flight crew has not yet returned, there must be a large number of [\wTransmitting Device\w]. Go to [Tylent Jungle] right now to help them out. But before you go, there is one thing that you need to keep in mind. We had to refit your GEAR to store all these devices but we did not have enough time to complete the job. By looking at your GEAR, you will only be able to store these devices for five minutes.

This message has shaken up the members of our Mercenary Army as well. There are already some who are thinking about switching to Arlington''s side, abandoning their positions and high payment. A Mercenary Army which fights for an ideal and passion rather than money...it is somewhat ironic. What do I think about it? Well...between you and me, I honestly don''t blame them. Bygeniou government is rotten to the core. I think that we were only able to make it this far because of <Blackwell>. Our futures are in jeopardy with Bygeniou''s incapable and incompetent officials.

Why have they returned? It was bad enough what they did last time. The only GEAR of theirs that has infiltrated our sky is the B-GEAR. They must have some sort of stealth technology that we are not aware of. If they really do have this stealth ability, then they have been busy reinforcing themselves while we have been squandering our own development of technology. I''m quite impressed! I would even applaud their drive and effort. However, the government is harassing us to bring them down right now so go out there and confront them. Your mission is to obtain 5 [Rebel Fighter Killmark] from [I-GEAR Early Type] that frequently appears at [Tylent Jungle]. The payment for this mission is not money but something special. Did you just ask me what the regular army is doing? The answer is simple; The government is extremely concerned that if the regular force went out it would damage their morale as they might be fighting their former comrades. But neither are we mercenaries here to do such a harsh chore. Our former comrades are surely on the other side as well. They must think that as we are a Mercenary Army we are merely drawn by money and we will have no compunction about shooting them down. Wrong!

Also, this stealth ability, which they did not think was possible, happened right in front of their own eyes! I can still see the bewilderment on the faces of the government officials. (Hiccup!) Hahaha. Did you just ask me if I''m drunk? Never! I''m just very depressed. Do you know who the pilot of the first Munebis airframe I shot down was? He was my drill master from the ATUM Project. More just and brave than anyone I have ever met and he became my enemy.......was shot down by a bullet from my own muzzle...I cannot forget his appearance, with his escape parachutes rope tangled around his neck. I am drinking to forget all about it. Should I be proud that have outdone my master? Or should I be sad with the fact that I had to handle my most respected idol as an enemy because of ideals?

It is also overcoming its adversities and obstacles with reliable skill and strong comradery. With its strong character of a foreign region, a free atmosphere is present, but its order structure is surprisingly strong for a new force and is gathering ardent support from local citizenry. They have only 2/3 of the members that Bygeniou''s <FreeSKA> has, but with rigorous training and briefing by the highly experienced <Isillis Guten> they have advanced themselves to a highly trained force that could even outdo <FreeSKA> in a short time. But, as usual, their short supply of members, components, and investment money to research special GEAR skills has allowed them to remain quite vulnerable to <FreeSKA>. <Munebis Mercenary Force>''s nickname is the <Sword of Arlington>.

When this mech came to Phillon planet the people of Phillon must have been astonished to see a gigantic metal god destroying everything with fire shooting out from its eyes. They must have named it <Lumein, god of fire>. But this mech must have lost its energy somehow and came here to get some planetary energy from this volcano. But before it could fulfill its purpose its energy levels must have hit rock bottom and it became dormant. I think it chose this volcano because a volcano of this size would be the biggest source to absorb as much planetary energy as it needed. Anyway, the Phillons must have been terrified to see this mech and tried to seal it by putting bricks around it while it lay "sleeping." After that, as the centuries flew by and it passed into legend, they worshipped this statue calling it <Lumein, god of fire>. While they were doing so the Phillons must have been terrified of its eventual awakening. Then, our advance forces must have inadvertently awakened the main computer of mech which was long thought to have stopped functioning. I think that the Gigantic God must have thought that it can recharge itself to function again. The raw, abundant energy in the lava flowing down the mountainside near it must have been siphoned somehow giving it enough to operate its weapons.

They were doing well to make next generation Decaian GEAR, with Shrine GEAR data in mind, but A.I. equipped GEARs are regularly attacking it . As they are new tech GEARs with new data loaded on them, most pilots cannot even make it close to the facility. So, we are sending you on a mission that has to be done by yourself.

I guess you did not know about that until now, right? Our ancestors first set their foot on this place to find the planetary energy source for <ATUM project>. However, a gigantic ocean earthquake occurred only about 1 year after the exploration so most of the city sank under the sea. Fortunately, most of the main facilities and manpower had been moved to [Bygeniou], minimizing the damage. Anyway, let me stop here with history and let us get down to some action.

This patrol boat was made to fight off Phillon monsters that were a threat to Deca & Vatallus. On this ship, anti-aircraft missiles, cannon and 1 <Osprey> were able to be equipped.

Destroy that laboratory, and capture the escape pod used by their executives so they can''t get their secrets away from us.';
$QUEST_2211_MID_TALK		= 	'Mission in progress. Destroy [NGC Laboratory] in the [Lost Oasis] and capture the [NGC Escape Pod].';
$QUEST_2211_SUCCESS_TALK	= 	'Message from <Hernez Santoriani>: It is time to interrogate the captured executives. I will let you know when I have the result. Well done.';
$QUEST_2211_DESCRIPTION		= 	'It was obvious that they were carrying out Oreutrium experiments in the NGC Laboratory. The planet we live on must not be ruined.';

$QUEST_2212_QUEST_NAME		= 	'Crack Down On BCU';
$QUEST_2212_PRE_TALK		= 	'Message from <Hernez Santoriani>: Finally, we have a chance to attack BCU. A moment ago, the remaining NGC forces performed a suicide attack on BCU pilots in the area, and assumed we were responsible. Looks like any truce we had is now over. You know what that means - clear out any BCU from the area.'; 
$QUEST_2212_MID_TALK		= 	'Mission in progress. Obtain [BCU Killmark] by shooting down BCU forces in the [Lost Oasis].';
$QUEST_2212_SUCCESS_TALK	= 	'Message from <Hernez Santoriani>: Those idiots will believe we attacked first no matter what we do... reason is beyond them. Good work in defending our interests.';
$QUEST_2212_DESCRIPTION		= 	'Between BCU and NGC, we have a lot of blood on our hands. Things are heating up.';

$QUEST_2213_QUEST_NAME		= 	'Marine Laboratory';
$QUEST_2213_PRE_TALK		= 	'Message from <Hernez Santoriani>: After interrogating the NGC executive you captured, we have found they have built a marine lab near Lost Oasis. We are not sure about the defenses of the lab, so we want to begin our assualt by sabotaging their supplies.';
$QUEST_2213_MID_TALK		= 	'Mission in progress. Destroy the [Laboratory Supply Container] in the [NGC Marine Ocean R&D].';
$QUEST_2213_SUCCESS_TALK	= 	'Message from <Hernez Santoriani>: Such tactics are necessary in war. You have done well, as always. We will begin preparations for our assault on what NGC forces remain.';
$QUEST_2213_DESCRIPTION		= 	'Destroying the NGC supplies has isolated their base and significantly impacted their defensive capabilities.';

$QUEST_2214_QUEST_NAME		= 	'Technology of NGC';
$QUEST_2214_PRE_TALK		= 	'Message from <Hernez Santoriani>: Damn it! The NGC have been using Oreutrium to create powerful new sentry turrets. These turrets represent a serious risk to us, but more importantly, the materials involved could also be used to bolster our own defenses. Go to their little lab, destroy the turrets, and bring me their spare parts.';
$QUEST_2214_MID_TALK		= 	'Mission in progress. Destroy [NGC Turret] and obtain [NGC Turret Part] in the [NGC Marine Ocean R&D].';
$QUEST_2214_SUCCESS_TALK	= 	'Message from <Hernez Santoriani>: That will do. Take a rest, you have certainly earned it. Our scientists and technicians will get to work on analyzing these samples. They have theorized that the NGC may have been involved in weapons manufacturing in the past, which explains why they are so advanced.';
$QUEST_2214_DESCRIPTION		= 	'The NGC turrets are advanced enough to suggest a high level of manufacturing sophistication. A dangerous threat indeed.';

$QUEST_2215_QUEST_NAME		= 	'The Power of Oreutrium';
$QUEST_2215_PRE_TALK		= 	'Message from <Hernez Santoriani>: By examining the machine gun turret parts you sent, we have concluded that Oreutrium was used for the main CPU and gun barrel. We suspect it functioned as some sort of booster. We also suspect that they have been experimenting with manufacturing GEARs using the same technology - which represents a major threat towards our air superiority. We need you to scout the NGC, and if our suspicions are right, destroy their GEARs by any means necessary.';
$QUEST_2215_MID_TALK		= 	'Mission in progress. Destroy [NGC GEARs] and collect their components in [NGC Marine Ocean R&D].';
$QUEST_2215_SUCCESS_TALK	= 	'Message from <Hernez Santoriani>: Am I ever wrong? This news is unsettling, but the parts you have collected will make for some interesting research, all the same.';
$QUEST_2215_DESCRIPTION		= 	'How could the NGC have possibly created such advanced technology in such a short time?';

$QUEST_2216_QUEST_NAME			= 	'Mothership';
$QUEST_2216_PRE_TALK		= 	'We have honed in on the NGC supply lines. They ferry Oreutrium to and from their laboratory using supply ships. Naturally, we are planning to intercept the supplies en route. Would you care to join our forces?';
$QUEST_2216_MID_TALK		= 	'Mission in progress. Destroy the [NGC Mothership] and obtain the supplies in the [NGC Marine Ocean R&D].';
$QUEST_2216_SUCCESS_TALK	= 	'Message from <Hernez Santoriani>: Message from <Craig Anderson>: To think that a standard transport would be equipped with such firepower... unheard of. These NGC get more cunning by the hour.';
$QUEST_2216_DESCRIPTION		= 	'Knowing the NGC can outfit even their supply ships with advanced weapons suggests that their threat is greater than we ever anticipated.';

$QUEST_2217_QUEST_NAME		= 	'Destroy Laboratory Base';
$QUEST_2217_PRE_TALK		= 	'Message from <Hernez Santoriani>: Damn. We were going to isolate the laboratory base, get inside and secure the place, but BCU seems to have the same plan. After a discussion, we have decided to destroy the base if we cannot have it. As our top pilot, you are the best for the job. We are all counting on you.';
$QUEST_2217_MID_TALK		= 	'Mission in progress. Destroy the [NGC Laboratory Base] in [NGC Marine Ocean R&D].';
$QUEST_2217_SUCCESS_TALK	= 	'Message from <Hernez Santoriani>: Better to destroy it than let BCU have it.  This will only anger them... for now, we can only watch and wait to see their response.';
$QUEST_2217_DESCRIPTION		= 	'It is a pity that we failed to get the Oreutrium-powered technology. Perhaps we will have another chance in the future.';
